A List Of ZeroDay Vulnerabilities Discovered By Byron Taaka (@4dbyron).
As they are Mostly/Potentially Still Active and No Yet Patched at the time of Inclusion,
Only Listing is done, without any finer details of the vulnerability.
Neither Exploits nor Payloads have been PUBLICLY included in this Repo,
So as to avoid Possible Abuse and Legal Implications.

# How Then Is This Repo Useful?
- They Say Iron Sharpens Iron. Or Something Close to That. üòâ
Listing A ZeroDay Not Only Triggers Ideas of what is Possible,
But Also Encourages Other Researchers/Pentesters to Look Closely into the Issue,
without Me blinding Them with My findings, as it could lead to Directed/Biased Research.

- To Showcase SOME of My Skills. üòé

- For Potential Gigs & **Educational** Knowledge Sharing.

- To Alert The Company's Internal DevSec Team to Up Their Security & Auditing.

- It Brings Me EXTRA Joy & Satisfaction.

- Because I Can! (Switching to Swahili Language): Ama? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
